This code makes use of my [Custom Java API](https://github.com/Dyndrilliac/java-custom-api). In order to build this source, you should clone the repository for the API using your Git client, then import the project into your IDE of choice (I prefer Eclipse), and finally modify the build path to include the API project. For more detailed instructions, see the README for the API project.

This repository contains all of the code that was written for the programming project assigned in COT 3210. The application demonstrates a class that provides a graphical display to the user showing a simulation of an initial infection vector spreading through a population operating under certain fundamental rules.
